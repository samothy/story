                <h3>The Middle</h3>
                <p>Your protagonist is now thrown into a world they don't understand. They might be doing well or they might be floundering, but either way this is exciting! Explosions, gunfights, puzzles, booby-traps, romantic tension &mdash; all the things that make it into the trailer usually come from The Middle.</p>
    
                <p>The Middle is the largest section of a story and it's where writers most often find themselves stumped. These are the doldrums where momentum fizzles out and the way forward is the most mysterious. The Beginning is for introductions and The End is for resolutions, but The Middle's mission is less clear. Bridging the gap in such a way that sets up a satisfying End is overwhelming when you're standing at the edge of the Beginning, staring out into the mist.</p>

                <p>While writers may never fully escape the paralyzing bigness of The Middle, we can at least fill our toolbox with some methods to put wind in the sails and keep the pages turning.</p>

            <h6 class='subsection-header' id='right-thing-wrong-way'>1. Doing the Right Thing the Wrong Way</h6>

                <br>

                <p>While I tend to think of The Middle as two parts with one major event smack in the middle, both of these parts are serving the same narrative purpose so it still makes sense to just call it all "The Middle." We'll talk more about the two distinct sections later.</p>

                <p>But first, what is the purpose that defines The Middle? As the title suggests, The Middle is where your protagonist is focused on their external goal, whatever that may be. The sports championship, the ancient artifact, the attractive co-star, or maybe even just survival. There will be many smaller objectives along the way, but always with a singular ultimate intent. This is the part of the movie that the trailer focuses on, usually. Explosions and kisses and all the other exciting things that made us pick this story in the first place.</p>

                <p>But the protagonist doesn't <em>need</em> the thing they're chasing in this part of the story. It is a product of, and a distraction from, the internal problem that they need to solve. This is why we say they're doing things "the wrong way."</p>

                <p>The show <em>My Name Is Earl</em> is a wonderful example of this concept. In every episode, former menace to society Earl Hickey picks one item from a list of all the bad things he's done in his life and aims to get right with whoever he hurt. Each of these individual missions contributes to the overall goal of fixing his karma &mdash; therefore allowing good things to happen to him.</p>

                <p>The genius of this show is that both the episode goals and the overall series goal are external objectives that hide the real prize: becoming a better person. Throughout the course of the show, Earl learns that by making amends with the victims of his many crimes to make good things happen to himself, what he's really doing is becoming a better human for its own sake.</p>

                <p>On the episode level, <em>My Name Is Earl</em> makes concrete examples of this abstract concept. In the pilot episode, Earl wants to help Kenny, a man whom he bullied in grade school. When Earl and his brother Randy discover that Kenny lives alone, they resolve to get him a girlfriend. This is a problem because it turns out Kenny is gay. In the end, what Earl and Randy really have to do is overcome their homophobia and take Kenny to a gay bar, something he's too afraid to do on his own.</p>

                <p>Earl <em>wants</em> to make up for bullying Kenny, but he <em>needs</em> to address his bigotry. This is the formula for every episode of the show &mdash; Earl and Randy set out with an actionable plan to do something external which ultimately leads Earl to fix something internal.</p>

                <p>I'm not gushing about <em>My Name Is Earl</em> just because it's an amazing show (which it is), but because it's an excellent example of something that all stories do. This dichotomy between the wants and needs of your protagonist is explored all throughout The Middle and provides a great deal of the tension and conflict.</p>

                <p>In chasing the goal they picked in The Beginning, your protagonist is going to reveal the worst parts of themselves. They're going to jeopardize everything to reach it, even if that means deceiving and betraying the people closest to them.</p>
                
                <p>In short, don't be afraid to make your protagonist do horrible things in the name of conquest. They're going to have plenty of time to do the admirable things later on. For now, they need to be ruthlessly focused on the external thing they want.</p>

            <h6 class='subsection-header' id='cadence-methods'>2. Cadence Methods</h6>

                <br>

                <p>A lot of storytellers find that their Middle sputters to a halt. Most often, this is because they didn't put in the work when they were at The Beginning, so either the protagonist's goal or their flaw isn't sufficiently clear. Or, gods forbid, the poor protagonist doesn't have either one at all.</p>

                <p>But if you feel confident in your Beginning and you still don't know how to proceed, there are lots of methods you can use to jumpstart the action. Coincidentally (or maybe it's not coincidence after all), the methods that are most effective in The Middle all have the same "push and pull" pattern to them, like ocean tides or breathing. For this reason, I call these methods "cadence methods," and they depend on this back-and-forth motion to work.</p>

                <p>These will be of particular interest to <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="The counterpart to planners who prefer to see no further than their headlights when writing.">pantsers</span>, because finishing one scene already gives you an idea of how to proceed. If you know all these methods, you're much less likely to write yourself into a corner or fizzle out.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The quote is a chapter title, but it might as well be the subtitle of <em>The Hobbit</em> because it captures the essence of any adventure story. The characters are immersed in a dangerous situation and forced to extract themselves using whatever tools they have on hand. However, by evading one enemy Bilbo and the dwarves immediately find themselves facing something else.</p>

                <p>This method is powerful because it grips the audience immediately. In <em>Saw</em>, the two main characters wake up in a dingy bathroom chained to pipes. We don't even know their names yet, but our curiosity is piqued and we need our ever-increasing list of questions answered. Primarily, how are they going to extract themselves from this room? Under the one Immersion/Extraction umbrella are a handful of smaller problems that Adam and Dr. Gordon need to overcome in order to appease the Jigsaw Killer.</p>

                <p>The quagmires and battles aren't random, but connected to each other and dependent on the way that your characters choose to extract themselves. This leads us to the next method:</p>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Therefore/But</h5>

                <br>

                <p>I believe this method was invented by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of <em>South Park</em>. The premise is that between every scene, you should be able to alternate the words Therefore and But.</p>

                <div class="jumbotron">

                    <h1>Therefore/But</h1>

                    <p>Cobb is a nerdy high school student who wants his popular classmates to think he's cool.</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>Cobb enters the school's talent show, which he overheard his crush Chelsea talking about.</p>

                    <p>BUT</p>

                    <p>Cobb doesn't actually have a talent.</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>He strikes a deal with a demon who offers him unbeatable talent.</p>
                    
                    <p>BUT</p>
                
                    <p>In exchange, the demon expects non-specific "favors."</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>Cobb's classmates start to be intrigued by him, seeing evidence of his new skills.</p>

                    <p>BUT</p>
                </div>

                <p>This is obviously a pretty cheesy premise for a story, but it does demonstrate the power of the two prepositions. </p>

                <p>Characters (and readers) need time to digest what just happened, plan what's next, and learn a little about each other.</p>
