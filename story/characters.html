              <p class='drop-caps'>Stories are about <span class='tooltips'>people<span class='tooltipstext'>Even if they're in the shape of animals, or cars, or... you know, household appliances. We can empathize with just about anything if they have human weaknesses and desires.</span></span>. We engage with stories of all kinds to find out who people are and what they've done. Audiences <em>like</em> time travel, muscle cars, giant monsters, and all the other exciting and imaginative things that take place in stories. But without the empathic bonds that a strong cast of characters provides, even the shocking and impossible will fall flat&mdash;all spectacle and no substance.</p>

              <p>Again, there are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to storytelling, but I can't recommend highly enough that you treat the characters and the web of their relationships as the foundation upon which to build your story. If you already have a premise that you believe in, tuck it somewhere safe for now. The decisions you make about the characters will entirely define how that premise is explored.</p>

              <p>We're going to spend a lot of time in the Build-A-Hero<sup>&#8482;</sup> workshop constructing a protagonist that's capable of carrying a story. However, we'll also look at how to cutivate a lively ecosystem of supporting characters and its impact on the story's shape.</p>

                  <p class='drop-caps'>Unlike a certain type of unbearable person we sometimes encounter in real life, the protagonist really is the center of their world. Everything and everyone they encounter is a refection of themselves in some capacity. It's important that the people inside the story&ndash;world don't know this&mdash;including the protagonist themselves, unless they're the aforementioned type of unbearable person&mdash;but you, the author, <em>must</em> be aware of it.</p>
    
                  <p>Protagonists come in all shapes and sizes, but the thing that they all have in common is that they have serious, serious problems. When we meet them at the beginning of the story, they are invariably engaging in some kind of <strong>antisocial behavior</strong> that's <strong>harming themselves and others</strong>.</p>

                  <p>In this chapter we'll explore why flawed protagonist are universal from children's stories to blockbuster movies and how to properly execute a flawed hero, but first let's see what happens if the protagonist has no flaws whatsoever:</p>

                  <br>
    
                  <p class='drop-caps'>When devising the character that's going to inhabit the spotlight of your story, the temptation may be to make them as idealized as possible. The real world is filled with imperfect people and heroes are supposed to be better. If we read stories to become better humans then a flawed protagonist is completely counterproductive! How is a reader supposed to root for a character whose defects are so close to the surface?</p>
    
                  <p>The temptation is understandable, but having an untouchable protagonist will only remove the tension from your story. Such a character can only serve as wish fulfillment and, contrary to popular belief, this is not what stories are for.</p>
    
                  <p>Let me put it this way: if your character is both morally sound and omnipotent, producing tension is a Catch-22. Any obstacle you put in their way will be conquered effortlessly&mdash;spelling death for the conflict and therefore your story. The only thing that <em>could</em> pose a threat is an even more powerful entity, and in that case your character has no room to grow in order to meet this threat. They have no deficiencies to work on and therefore any improvements will be arbitrary. This is part of why <a href='http://www.sam-frost.com/pages/blog#superman-movies'>Superman movies always suck.</a></p>
    
                  <p>With a well-rounded protagonist, you can think of the core flaw as the one thing that puts them at a disadvantage against their antagonist. It's the handicap that stops the plot from being resolved immediately. After your protagonist gets beaten down and all hope seems lost (and they finally have no choice but to change), they grow. They can return to battle with their new strengths and finally overcome the obstancles standing between them and the story resolution. Is this starting to sound familiar?</p>
    
                  <p>The protagonist's desires drive the story, but their flaw <em>is</em> the story. Don't be afraid to really mess them up in the head. They're going to get better, and so is your story.</p>
    
                  <hr class='between-topics'>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>What Is a Core Flaw?</h5>
    
                  <br>
    
                  <p class='drop-caps'>The main character is going to have many flaws, but one will rise above the others to define both the character of your protagonist and the narrative shape of your story as a whole.</p>
    
                  <p>Not just any flaw will do for this purpose.</p>
    
                  <p>This is one of the few situations where I will be adamant about a rule. A compelling, story-carrying flaw adheres to not one but all three of the following characteristics:</p>
    
                  <ol>
                    <li>The flaw is dangerous and unsustainable. It damages the protagonist's relationships and/or is detrimental to their life in other ways. If they don't address this flaw soon, they will face serious consequences.</li>
                    <li>The protagonist has the ability to fix this flaw if they wanted to. They <em>don't</em> want to, and invariably will choose not to change, but changing is within their power from the moment we meet them.</li>
                    <li>The flaw is internal to the protagonist and not imposed from the outside. In other words, it is a result of their own choices and not the actions of others or forces of nature outside their control.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>The most commonly overlooked aspect is the internal/external thing. When a writer is too deeply in love with their protagonist, the temptation is to generate tension by plaguing them with enemies and obstacles. They're hindered down by past trauma. Their rival keeps outshining them. Their boss is an asshole. They're "too noble" and keep getting punished for doing the right thing.</p>
                  
                  <p>Don't get me wrong, there <em>should</em> be enemies and obstacles and there's nothing inherently wrong with external forces working against the hero. But unless these obstacles are reflections of their internal flaw, that just makes the protagonist a victim. Sympathetic, maybe, but not compelling, partially because their conflicts have either <em>no</em> solution (because there wasn't a conflict to begin with), or only one predictable solution&mdash;defeat the villain one the surface level.</p>

                  <p>They key, then, is to give the external flaws some connection to what's wrong with the protagonist internally. This way when your protagonist overcomes them it really feels like they grew as a person and earned the victory. The solutions to these conflicts will be surprising and weighty emotionally. Here are some examples:</p>
                  
                  <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                      <tr>

                        <th scope="col">Core Flaw</th>
                      </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Trauma</td>
                        <td>An unhealthy response to trauma that is harmful to themselves or the people around them</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>A rival that outshines them</td>
                        <td>Why does it bother the protagonist that someone is better than them? Is it a competition, or just insecurity?</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Being too noble and virtuous</td>
                        <td>Being noble for the wrong reasons; glory, "the greater good," etc. Getting involved in battles they don't need to be in.</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>An asshole boss</td>
                        <td>If the poor treatment truly isn't deserved (and be honest about this), then what's stopping the protagonist from quitting?</td>
                      </tr>

                  <p>I hope you like this topic, because the protagonist's flaw is woven into just about everything. The characters define how the story unfolds, and the protagonist defines the other characters (to some degree).</p>

                  <p class='drop-caps'>Your protagonist is an idiot. Don't worry&mdash;that's a good thing. You <em>want</em> them to be an idiot. Intelligence has nothing to do with it. I'm sure your protagonist is perfectly intelligent and capable, but they also happen to be an idiot. It's not hyperbole to say that if they weren't an idiot there would be no story at all.</p>
    
                  <p>Humans have blind spots. We have flaws that we don't like addressing because change is painful and denial is comfortable. There's a disconnect, something separating us from being happy and fulfilled, but we're famously bad at identifying it. The problem invariably comes from inside our own heads and yet we consistently point the finger at external things like prizes to win and enemies to vanquish.</p>
                  
                  <p>What is your protagonist's deepest, most precious desire? What's the one thing that makes them think, "If I did this, I could finally be happy?" Spoiler alert: not only is this desire misguided, it's a direct product of the aforementioned blind spot. But if the protagonist understood this right out of the gate it would be a very short and boring story. Change is painful and a person will only do it if <em>not</em> changing is even more painful. <strong>Show the reader exactly how much pain it's going to take to make your protagonist wake up and face their own shortcomings and voila, you have a story.</strong></p>
    
                  <p>I imagine you have two concerns at this point.</p>
    
                  <p>1. This feels like putting the cart before the horse. First we were talking about the protagonist and now you want me to map out the whole story? In the <em>first bullet point of the entire Three-Act Structure?</em></p>
    
                  <p>Don't worry; we're not even done talking about the main character yet. There's plenty more to say and we'll discuss the finer points of plot structure in gritty detail. But the importance of the protagonist's flaw cannot be overstated, and it's something well worth thinking about as you decide the kind of story you want to tell.</p>
    
                  <p>2. If you thought, "Showing the protagonist the error of their ways is great and all, but surely that's not all a story is," you'd be absolutely right. Good stories (in the Western world, at least) do countless other things to transport us to another world. But the theme is what <em>every</em> good Western story does, and the theme stems from your protagonist.</p>
    
                <hr class='between-topics'>
    
                <h4 class="chapter-title" id='three-pillars'>Chapter X: The Three Pillars</h4>
    
                  <br>
    
                  <p class='drop-caps'>Making a protagonist fascinating is obviously a complex process, and if there were an easy answer you wouldn't be here. But the Three Pillars method is a relatively simple way to cover your bases. Characters that keep us on the edges of our seats wondering what they'll do next have the following qualities:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>Likeable</li>
                    <li>Competent</li>
                    <li>Proactive</li>
                  </ul>
    
                  <p>Simple, right? Now we just have to get rid of one.</p>
    
                  <p>It's <em>possible</em> to have a fascinating character with all three pillars intact, but it's difficult. We know already that a character's flaws are intrinsically tied with the emotional core of the story, and it's harder to believe that a character who's good at everything has a deep enough flaw.</p>
                  
                  <hr class='between-topics-lite'>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Proactive</h5>
                  <p>Let's assume you won't be touching the "proactive" pillar since we learned earlier that a character's desires are what fuel the story. If your protagonist doesn't have some get-up-and-go then why are they the center of the narrative at all? As always, there are some possible exceptions, but if you don't nail it the protagonist is going to be carried along by your story instead of carrying it themselves. Reacting is the audience's job and they don't need someone to show them how to do it. So if we're being honest, the list looks more like this:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>Likeable</li>
                    <li>Competent</li>
                    <li><strike>Proactive</strike></li>
                  </ul>
    
                  <p>That leaves two options. Do you make your character repulsive or do you make them useless? If this seems like a bad start to the person who's going to be at the center of an epic story, now is a good time to mention that these pillars are really more like sliders on your protagonist's dashboard. They're not fixed and can change as the story progresses. It's even possible that there will be times when your character will become less proactive &mdash; but there's a specific part of the story where that's particularly effective and we'll get to that later.</p>
    
                  <hr class='between-topics'>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Competent</h5>
    
                  <p>The obvious archetype for someone with low competence is the underdog, which affords countless narrative opportunities. The underdog is someone that the audience can relate to very quickly because powerlessness is a feeling that everyone can understand. Mulan comes to mind as an example; she flounders both as a fighter and as a woman-in-disguise, but we still want to know what she'll do next because she's proactive as hell. Her competence slider gets dragged upwards during the "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" montage, but that's not the Mulan we meet in Act I.</p>
    
                  <p>A related but subtly different option is the fish-out-of-water: somebody who's competent in their Act I world but forced into an Act II where their skills are useless. Consider Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) in <em>Liar Liar</em>. He's successful as a lawyer because of his talent at bending the truth, but his "competent" pillar crumbles in Act II when his ability to lie is taken from him.</p>

                  <p>Breaking down this pillar is my personal preferred technique for making an interesting protagonist. There's been a long and successful string of ethically-challenged TV protagonists that we love to hate. Walter White, Don Draper, Tony Soprano, Frank Underwood. What they all have in common is that we know they're bad, but we can't stop watching because they're just too damn interesting. Whatever's coming next isn't gonna be good but we sure aren't going to miss it.</p>
                  
                  <p>A reprehensible protagonist also kills two birds with one stone by having their core flaw right out there in the open. A likeable character requires you to be more clever with revealing their downsides. We don't need to be told that something is wrong with Frank Underwood.</p>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Fan-Favorite Villains</h5>
    
                  <p>Villains will sometimes overshadow their protagonist and become the driving force of a story. This is because villains, by definition, need to be both competent and proactive. Otherwise they're not a threat, they're just a person who happens to disagree with the good guys. This means that if you accidentally sprinkle in some charisma, they're going to have three strong pillars and dominate the scene.</p>
                  
                  <p>This happens most often in long TV shows where characters go through numerous different arcs. Villains are redeemed on TV much more frequently than in any other medium, where viewer preferences have a significant impact on the course of the story. To avoid the story revolving around a fan-favorite villain, what usually happens is that the source of their power is taken away, leaving an enthusiastic and sympathetic helper.</p>
    
                  <p>If you find that scenes involving your villain are way more interesting than the ones with your hero, it's time to step back and do some thinking. First look at the protagonist and make sure that their flaw is compelling and that one or more of their pillars <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="The ones that you didn't remove intentionally, that is.">aren't missing</span>. You also need to consider the possibility that your "antagonist" is actually the center of the story.</p>

                  <p>While we're on the topic of villains...</p>

                  <p class='drop-caps'>A story raises two major questions. The plot question is simple and literal and boils down to "Will the hero achieve their desires?" Will the boy and the girl get together? Will the chosen one defeat the dark lord? Will the career criminals pull off the heist? You can think about this question as the sugar-coating that helps the second question go down, and that's the theme.</p>
                  
                  <p>The theme is the subtextual question that explores some aspect of the human experience. What do we owe each other as humans? Is death something to be feared? Are there crimes that can't be forgiven? Calling the theme a "moral" misses the mark somewhat&mdash;the author often provides several answers to the theme question and allows the reader the opportunity to weigh them. When one answer is too heavily favored over all others, the story stops being a story and becomes a sermon.</p>

                  <p>The protagonist represents one answer to the theme question. More than any other character, the job of antagonistic forces of the story is to cast doubt on that answer. It's easy to be virtuous when you're safe and warm, but will the hero stick to their guns when the antagonist makes their life hell? There are a wide variety of antagonists to choose from and they each serve a different kind of story and a different kind of theme question. What they <em>all</em> have in common, however, is that the antagonist pushes the hero to their breaking point and makes them confront their own beliefs.</p>

                  <p class='drop-caps'>If the purpose of the antagonist is to apply pressure to the protagonist, a human isn't strictly necessary for the role. The world is full of powers out of our control that push us to the brink without any help from other people.</p>

                  <p>Natural disaster movies have been impossible to escape for the past two or three decades. Tornadoes, earthquakes, asteroids, volcanoes, storms that capsize boats or bury hotels in snow. There's no shortage of meteorological events that power the conflict in movies. This is a perfectly valid premise for a story because it removes all pretense. On the individual and societal levels, priorities change in the face of a crisis.</p>

                  <p>But the events don't need to be natural to be a Force of Nature. How about a zombie apocalypse? A visit from Godzilla or a horde of aliens, perhaps.</p>

                  <p>What these all have in common is that as the audience we don't need to know <em>why</em> these things are happening. The volcano doesn't need backstory to explain why it erupts and zombies repel empathy even if they look like humans. The Force of Nature antagonist doesn't explore the theme by posing another philosophical answer to the theme question&mdash;all it does is apply increasing amounts of pressure on the protagonist until they snap and do something they regret.</p>

                  <p>The complete lack of empathy for the antagonist puts the spotlight on the protagonist. The theme is explored by their reactions to the obstacles posed by the natural disaster, not the disaster itself.</p>

                  <p class='drop-caps'>There's no shortage of harsh criticism for this particular trope, usually on the basis that Dark Lords are flat characters. After all, we saw earlier that a good antagonist needs to have empathetic motivations and desires&mdash;they need to be <em>persuasively</em> wrong. A character that's evil just for the sake of evil is boring, cliche, and suitable only for children's stories.</p>

                  <p>I disagree.</p>

                  <p>The Dark Lord can be abused just like any other trope, but in the right hands they serve as a perfectly acceptable way to explore a complex theme. The problem doesnt come from the concept of the Dark Lord itself, but from treating the Dark Lord like any other human character. For all intents and purposes, the Dark Lord is a natural disaster; an existential threat that can't be reasoned with and whose motivations are opaque and inconsequential. The only difference is that the Dark Lord is in the shape of a human being. They <em>symbolize</em> a human, but don't behave like one in story terms.</p>

                  <p>In other words, much like a natural disaster the power of a Dark Lord comes from their effect on the human characters around them. The good guys turn on each other, the hero is forced into impossible decisions, rational and empathetic characters decide to become the Dark Lord's followers. The Dark Lords themselves <span class='tooltips'>don't get a lot of screen time<span class='tooltipstext'>Sauron has perhaps the worst ratio in all of cinema, receiving four minutes of screen time in the entire trilogy.</span></span> because, well, they <em>are</em> flat characters.</p>

                  <p>In fact, trying to add empathy to a Dark Lord will only weaken the impact of your story. There's not enough humanity left to be reasoned with or be converted to the "good" side. This would be the equivalent of a ragtag group of astronauts landing on an asteroid and changing its course by asking nicely. The Dark Lord must be defeated, and the victory can only come after the protagonist solves their inner crisis.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class='drop-caps'>The protagonist is the center of the story world. But the other characters don't know that and would certainly dispute it if you asked them.</p>

                    <p>We already know your protagonist is at odds with themselves and that their ultimate success or failure depends on their struggle against a primary antagonist. You have two sides to the story. Your audience is even conflicted about which side is right.</p>
                        
                    <p>That's an acceptable exploration of the theme. But if two characters are good at exploring a theme... wouldn't <em>four</em> characters do it <em>even better?</em></p>

                    <p>In an ideal four-corner opposition, all four people are in conflict with each of the other members. This means you don't have three villains lined up for the hero to vanquish one-by-one. In fact, they don't even need to opponents to the protagonist in the strict sense. These are four fully-fledged people who each have their own goals and fundamental philosophical differences with the other three. If you put any two of them in a room, there would be friction and chemistry because of the unique ways their ideologies interact.</p>

                    <p>Here's an example from the Harry Potter series, spanning all 7 books. Select two characters and see the unique ways that they interact regarding the themes (fear vs. acceptance of death, love vs. detachment, self-serving vs. self-sacrificing).</p>

                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Flip Characters</h5>

                    <p>The story would be pretty exhausting if the hero was fighting against all three opponents at all times. Some characters will flip sides or exist entirely outside of the binary opposition between the protagonist and the antagonist. Flip Characters are chasing their own goals just like everyone else and might take and switch sides if they think it'll serve themselves in some way. </p>

                    <p>A fleeting but excellent example is Narcissa Malfoy in <em>Harry Potter</em>. Narcissa is a minor character and certainly not part of the four-corner opposition, but in a large-scale epic with over 700 characters there are countless overlapping oppositions. During the climax of the final book, Narcissa betrays Lord Voldemort in order to protect Draco, her son. Not only is this a signal on the plot level that Voldemort's victory is being undermined, but it reinforces the theme that love is more powerful than fear. At this point in the story the Malfoys are beaten into submission by Voldemort and the punishment for disobedience is death, and yet Narcissa still puts her master's mission and her own life at risk because of the love she feels for Draco. There are human beings on both sides of this war.</p>

                    <p>Other examples of antagonistic forces who switch sides and join the hero's party for the final struggle include Fezzik and Inigo in <em>The Princess Bride</em>, Zuko in <em>Avatar</em>, and Miguel's dead family members in <em>Coco</em>.</p>

                    <p>But a character flipping isn't always beneficial to the hero. DJ from <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> is used by the writers to help the good guys escape a dangerous situation, only to drop them into a more dangerous situation to his own benefit. He then reveals that his name stands for "Don't Join," which is a cheesy writing choice but magnificent as an example of a Flip Character who has goals totally unrelated to those of the heroes.</p>

                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Dark Reflections</h5>

                    <p>If the protagonist has a morally complex goal (revenge, for example), they'll easily ignore or justify the sinful things they need to do in order to accomplish it. In this case, it can be very effective to have another character with the same or a very similar goal so that the protagonist can witness their own actions from the outside.</p>

                    <p>As with any character, it's important that this Dark Reflection character feel fully justified in their actions, because seeing the disparity between the Dark Reflection's actions and the morals they claim to uphold is going to force the protagonist to take a closer look at their own actions. Bonus points if you can have both the protagonist <em>and</em> the reader have the revelation at the same time.</p>

                <h4 class="chapter-title" id='theme-stated'>Chapter X: Theme Stated</h4>
    
                <br>
    
                  <p>Yes, this is one of the beats in Blake Snyder's formula, but I felt the need to address it for two reasons. One, it's super interesting and important for the integrity of your story. Two, a quick Google search reveals that this beat is also widely misunderstood&mdash;countless well-meaning articles poorly explain how a theme is stated in a story and occasionally what a theme is to begin with.</p>

                  <p>I've thrown the term theme around a lot, particularly in the previous section regarding the four-corner opposition. In the most simplistic terms, the theme is the philosophical question that's raised by the story ("Is it ever right to kill somebody?"). I say a "question" instead of "moral" because the theme isn't necessarily an instruction manual on morality. That said,  there's usually a strong preference for one answer to the question over any others ("Yes, but only if they're <em>evil</em>").</p> 

                  <p>This question is posed by your protagonist's flaw and the ways that it hurts themselves and the people around them. </p>
    
                  <p>At this point, the reader knows that your protagonist has a flaw. The other characters in the story also know that the protagonist has a flaw. In fact this flaw is probably hurting them directly. The only one who doesn't know about the protagonist's flaw is the protagonist themself.</p>
    
                  <p>In Act I, one of these supporting characters will try to fix that. They're going to confront the protagonist and tell them what's wrong with their worldview. Sometimes this is done more subtly than others, but it's always there.</p>
    
                  <p>The implication of this beat is that the protagonist has the answer to their problem from the very beginning. They could prevent all the trials and suffering that the rest of the story has for them if they just listen to this intervention. But their desire is too strong and they'll brush off the advice.</p>
    
                  <p>This seems like an bizarre thing for <em>every</em> story to have. Surely a smart enough protagonist would see the wisdom of advice given to them. Or if they trusted the secondary character enough, they would take the advice grudgingly. But change is painful, remember? At this point in the story, not-changing is still more comfortable than changing. Besides, this isn't a matter of intelligence. The protagonist's thoughts are clouded by their desire for their goal. They'll come up with any number of excuses to discard the theme.</p>
    
                  <p>Not only is this universal, but it also produces some of the most memorable lines in storytelling. A mere handful of examples:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>"With great power comes great responsibility."</li>
                    <li>"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."</li>
