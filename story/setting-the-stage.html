                    <br>
        
                    <p>Before we dive into any of the nuts-and-bolts, let's talk about you. Yes, you.</p>
    
                    <p>Part of <a href='#'>inducing the story trance</a> is communicating your credibility to the audience. Why should a reader invest their time into your story in particular? What makes you qualified to be a storyteller?</p>
                    
                    <p>If you think about it, a printed book has credibility built right into it. Merely by nature of the fact that a story is in book form means that a publishing house thought it was worth the printing and marketing costs. Multiple people throughout the distribution process decided that the price on the cover is what you ought to pay for the right to read it. There's even an "About the Author" page listing the storyteller's accolades and titles. If they're a well-established author, the cover will also tell you what other stories they've told&mdash;thousands of readers just like you already vetted this author. In other words, the question of whether the author is the real deal is more or less decided. All that's left is whether the story itself is to your taste.</p>
    
                    <p>"Okay, that's great and all," you may be thinking. "But I'm not a published author yet and I'm not making any money from my stories." It's okay, there are other ways of telling a potential reader that you brought your A-game.</p>
    
                    <p>Essentially it all boils down to taking yourself seriously. If you truly believe in your story and think an audience's time would be well spent on it, people will <em>feel</em> that. They will be unconsciously coaxed into the story state by the way the story itself is presented.</p>

                      <p>I know this seems obvious, but nothing is less conducive to a story state than sentence-level language problems. In imaginationland, anything can happen&mdash;as long as we can forget it's a story. Suspension of disbelief can convince me that donkeys to fly, but not that multiple exclamation points are appropriate.</p>
    
                      <p>Go over your story several times. Read it out loud. Show it to a friend. Anything to iron out the easily preventable mistakes. Don't give lazy critics any excuse to stop reading. If the surface of your story is flawless they have no choice but to go deeper and confront the content, and that means <em>you win</em> (even if they don't like it).</p>

                    <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Don't Talk Bad About Yourself</h5>
    
                      <p>I see this a lot in self-published writing online. Wherever the website gives the author a chance to describe themselves or their work, there's almost always some element of self-deprecation. They place emphasis on how little time it took to write or the odd hour at which it was written or any number of other preemptive defenses against criticism.</p>
    
                      <p>The temptation is easy to understand. Everyone wants to be the accidental genius whose throwaway works garner unexpected attention. Or perhaps the author is deathly afraid of negative feedback and believes the reviews will hurt less if they weren't really trying to begin with.</p>
    
                      <p>But you <em>are</em> trying, aren't you? If not, why should I click your link at all? You're trying to hook readers. Showcasing how little effort went in is a bad start.</p>
    
                      <p>Resist the urge to cushion yourself against the haters. They will come, and it will hurt, but you're a <em>storyteller</em>. You have something important to say, goddammit. Don't dissuade someone who might have been touched by your work.</p>

                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Avoid Cliches</h5>
    
                      <p>Cliches and tropes are often confused with one another (and with good reason), so let's clear up the difference right off the bat.</p>
    
                      <p>A group of people wearing hooded robes are standing in a circle around an altar upon which an unconscious woman is lying. One of the robed figures is reciting Latin from an open book and the others repeat the words in unison. What can we, the readers, extrapolate from this? Well, this group is clearly a cult, and almost certainly an <em>evil</em> one. The woman on the altar is a victim of the cult, not a member, and about to be sacrificed to some otherwordly entity. This entire process is almost certainly going to be interrupted by the hero somehow. That's a lot of information conveyed in a very short amount of time. And, because the reader is consciously or unconsciously expecting this trope to play out, that gives you the opportunity to modify or subvert it.</p>
    
                      <p>Tropes are tools that can be used well or not-so-well, and if you use a trope without being cognizant of its full range of meanings, it falls into cliche territory. Not all cliches exist on the image level, however. Cliches most often happen on the language level and these are the most insidious.</p>
    
                      <p>By using a cliche, either at the conceptual level ("My two lead characters are in love but they can only show it by being mean to each other.") or at the language level (<em>"They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</em>), you're sacrificing the opportunity to make that moment belong to you and only you, to tell a story that nobody else could tell. What you're saying is that your idea wasn't even important enough to come up with a new combination of words.</p>

                      <p>A good way to test if something is a language-level cliche is to take the phrase out of context. If you can still tell exactly who said it, it's not a cliche.</p>
    
                      <p>The story that's waiting to be told by you is completely unique and nobody else on earth could tell it exactly the way you do. </p>
    
                      <hr>
    
                    <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Host Creatively</h5>
    
                      <p>If you self publish your work online, consider buying a domain and putting it there instead of submitting it to an existing site. You know, like I did. Surely I'm not biased on this.</p>
    
                      <p>Making a website seems like a hassle and maybe like overkill. If that's the case, re-evaluate your story and figure out <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="Have some faith. You know deep down that your story deserves an audience. What are you willing to do to get it?">why it doesn't deserve its own website</span>. However, if you're just intimidated by the idea of web development itself, take a deep breath. You don't need to be a computer whiz to do such a thing these days. There are plenty of services that allow you to create highly customized sites with relative ease.</p>
    
                      <p>The main benefit of doing this is <em>instant credibility</em>. This person has a website with their name in the URL... they must be for real. If they thought their work deserved this kind of treatment then there must be something to it (They don't need to know that it costs about the same as a Netflix subscription).</p>
    
                      <p>If you're worried about getting traffic to your work, consider how much traffic you're currently getting. On submission-based platforms your work is thrown in with all the rest. The story next to yours could be spectacular (competing with you) or terrible (damaging your credibility by association). It may take some time to accumulate an audience on a site of your own, but they will be <em>yours.</em> They navigated to your site to read your work and nothing else.</p>
    
                      <p>If you're making video content, YouTube is probably still your best bet. But knock yourself out creating a website for the content that YouTube isn't built for (community engagement, author bio, event schedules, etc).</p>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>The Two-Way Street</h5>
    
                  <p>Storytelling is a collaborative effort. The author partially explains and the reader must come forward to meet them in the middle somewhere. The ratio of the work the author and the reader does varies tremendously, but in every story there's a form of the Socratic method at work. When the reader stops needing to do that work (small and enjoyable as the work may be), they'll put down the book. The suspense and mystery are gone. There are no more questions left to answer.</p>

                  <p>The moment that a reader picks up a book is magic. There's a negotiation taking place across time and space between the author and the reader. Besides money, the reader brings something more precious and irretrievable to the table &mdash; their time. In exchange, the author promises to provide a great story.</p>

                  <p>So what does that actually entail?</p>

                  <p>Yes, the author promises to entertain and delight, but this isn't all. In a way, the reader is also a protagonist. Their desire for entertainment is what made them pick up the book, but what they <em>need</em> is for their humanity to be addressed in some way &mdash; to be soothed, nourished, educated, vindicated, maybe even chastised. By watching protagonists grow, we grow ourselves.</p>

                  <hr>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>The Opening Image</h5>

                  <p>An author also makes more practical promises. In order to earn the reader's time, the author makes a kind of down-payment on what they promise to deliver in installments throughout the story. It's a show of good faith that you, the author, are capable of giving the reader what they came for.</p>

                  <p>This is why <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="See? Just as I promised.">the first scene is important.</span> This is where the reader decides whether to sign the contract or not. The first scene is your pitch. The author says, "This is the kind of story I'm about to tell. There's going to be some exposition in a minute, but then we're coming back to <em>this right here.</em></p>

                  <p>It may not have anything to do with your protagonist at all. Think of the police procedural dramas that always start with a murder. We don't know the victim and they're not going to appear alive in the episode again, but this scene tells a lot about the kind of show you're about to watch. There's a killer on the loose, and someone is going to have to figure out who they are and catch them, if possible.</p>

                  <p>The first scene of <em>Game of Thrones</em> shows us the threat of White Walkers, and then we spend several seasons dealing with strictly human conflicts. But the White Walkers are never forgotten &mdash; we trust that they'll come back because George made a promise. The title of the book saga also makes a promise: A Song of Ice and Fire. Ice will be important and fire will be important. Dragons. White Walkers. For the White Walkers to become a threat later in the series would have felt like a non-sequitur if there hadn't been a considerable amount of groundwork.</p>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Death of the Author</h5>

                  <p>I'm sure you've heard this term before. There's a considerable amount of discourse on this, especially in an age where the identities of content creators are so visible online. The basic question is to what degree, if at all, an author's work can be analyzed in the context of the life of the author themselves.</p>

                  <p>This is a very complicated topic and I don't think it's very productive for our purposes. However, it does raise another interesting question: How much power does an author have over the way their work is interpreted? What is the important of author intent?</p>

                  <p>Stories are powerful things. Your story is going to affect people, and you won't be able to control the ways that it does. </p>

                  <hr>

                  <p>We've got a solid cast of characters. We understand our privileges and responsibilities as the storyteller. At last, we're ready to proceed to The Middle, the most fearsome part of any story.</p>

                  <h5 class="h5-subhead">Avoid Cliches</h5>
  
                    <p>First, because the two often get confused, let's discuss the difference between cliches and tropes.</p>
  
                    <p>A trope is a shortcut that saves time for the reader, transmitting a lot of information about a story in not a lot of time. Used properly, a trope can be a tool to bring a reader right up to your wavelength.</p>
  
                    <p>A cliche is a shortcut that saves time for the <em>author</em>, and transmits very little information because of the lack of specificity.</p>
  
                    <p>By using a cliche, either at the conceptual level ("My two lead characters are in love but they can only show it by being mean to each other.") or at the language level ("<em>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</em>"), what you're saying is that your idea wasn't even important enough to come up with a new combination of words.</p>
  
                    <p>In short, don't be afraid to recycle a story element you find useful (steal like an artist, am I right?). But be honest with yourself about what is a creative re-working of an idea and what's just lazy.</p>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Host Creatively</h5>
  
                    <p>If you post your writing online (or a webcomic, for that matter), buy a domain and put it there instead. You know, like I did. Surely I'm not biased on this.</p>
  
                    <p>Making a website seems like a hassle and maybe like overkill. If that's the case, re-evaluate your story and figure out why it doesn't deserve its own website. However, if you're just intimidated by the idea of web development itself, take a deep breath. You don't need to be a computer whiz to do such a thing these days. There are plenty of services that allow you to create highly customized sites with relative ease.</p>
  
                    <p>The main benefit of doing this is <em>instant credibility</em>. This person has a website with their name in the URL... they must be for real. If they thought their work deserved this kind of treatment then there must be something to it (They don't need to know that it costs about the same as a Netflix subscription).</p>
  
                    <p>If you're worried about getting traffic to your work, consider how much traffic you're currently getting. On submission-based platforms your work is thrown in with all the rest. The story next to yours could be spectacular (competing with you) or terrible (damaging your credibility by association). It may take some time to accumulate an audience, but they will be <em>yours.</em> They navigated to your site to read your work and nothing else.</p>
  
                    <p>If you're making video content, YouTube is probably still your best bet. But knock yourself out creating a website for the content that YouTube isn't great at (community engagement, author bio, event schedules, etc).</p>
