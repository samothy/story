            <p>There's no such thing as a hard-and-fast rule when it comes to creative work, and storytelling is no different. The criteria for what is considered a good story will be different across cultures, genres, mediums, all the way down to individual tastes. There can never be a single unified theory that explains what is compelling and emotionally stirring about every story in the world.</p>
            
            <p>There are, however, a handful of patterns that <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='top' title="Stories in the western world, at least.">stories</span> share. Writers and academics have bundles these patterns into what I call storytelling methods, parts of which you may have been taught in school. Each method has <em>internally consistent</em> rules that are applicable within the confines of that method. If you're writing <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='top' title="Essentially a novel or a feature-length screenplay, although ">a long form story</span> for a Western audience, the Storyteller's Dictionary can help you.</p>

            <p>In short, no method is more "accurate" than another. No method cuts deeper into the essence of storytelling than another. But one of them may be <em>useful</em> for the purpose at hand, which is all a storytelling method can claim to achieve. There are stories I love that contradict a lot of the concepts I've written here, and a hypothetical story that follows all of this advice wouldn't necessarily be good.</p>

            <p>However, what you read here may help you to analyze the stories that have affected you personally and figure out what it is that makes them powerful and moving. They may shed light on a story that you're struggling to tell and show the way forward.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Here are the primary problems with this site, in no particular order:</p>

            <p>Although I'm going to use language that addresses writers of fiction, particularly novelists, these storytelling methods will be useful across genres and mediums. Just swap out the appropriate words and see if it still works.</p>

            <p>There will be spoilers, and I can't think of any way to give adequate warnings without disrupting the site too much. So if I spoil something you intended to read or watch, I apologize.</p>
