            <h6 class="subsection-header mb-3" id='intro-pt-1'>Storytelling Methods</h6>

            <p>As with any creative pursuit, there are no hard-and-fast rules involved in storytelling. The criteria for what is considered a good story will be different across cultures, genres, mediums, all the way down to individual tastes. There can never be a single unified theory that explains what is compelling and emotionally stirring about every story in the world.</p>
            
            <p>There are, however, a handful of patterns that many stories share. Writers and academics have bundles these patterns into storytelling methods, some of which you may have been taught in school. Each method has <em>internally consistent</em> rules that are applicable within the confines of that method. This is what the Storyteller's Dictionary aims to teach.</p>

            <p>You will not become a master storyteller based only on what you read here. However, one or more storytelling methods may allow you to analyze the stories that have affected you personally and figure out what it is that makes them powerful and moving. They may shed light on a story that you're struggling to tell and show the way forward.</p>

            <p>In short, no method is more "accurate" than another. No method cuts deeper into the essence of storytelling than another. But one of them may be <em>useful</em> for the purpose at hand, which is all a storytelling method can claim to achieve.</p>

            <p>One thing that most people can agree on, however, is that stories have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. No matter your processes and methods and genres, it's difficult to argue against that. For that reason, I'll try to avoid jargon and divide story into these three parts and explain the goals of each part using various methods.</p>

            <h6 class="subsection-header mb-3" id='intro-pt-1'>Disclaimers</h6>

            <p>Here are the primary problems with this site, in no particular order:</p>

            <p>Although I'm going to use language that addresses writers of fiction, particularly novelists, these storytelling methods will be useful across genres and mediums. Just swap out the appropriate words and see if it still works.</p>

            <p>There will be spoilers, and I can't think of any way to give adequate warnings without disrupting the site too much. So if I spoil something you intended to read or watch, I apologize.</p>
