            <p>There's no such thing as a hard-and-fast rule when it comes to creative work, and unfortunately storytelling is no different. The criteria for what is considered a good story will vary between cultures all the way down to individual tastes. No unified theory could ever explain what is compelling and emotionally stirring about <em>every</em>> story in the world.</p>
            
            <p>There are, however, a handful of patterns that stories share&mdash;in the Western world, at least. Writers and academics have a lot of fun bundling these patterns into what I call storytelling methods, some of which you may have been taught in school. Each method has <em>internally consistent</em> rules that are applicable within the confines of that method. If you're writing a long-form story for a Western audience, the Storyteller's Dictionary can help you.</p>

            <p>No method is more "accurate" than another or cuts more deeply into the essence of storytelling. There are stories I love that contradict much of what I've written here, and a hypothetical story that follows all of this advice wouldn't necessarily be good. But one or more of these methods may be <em>useful</em> for the purpose at hand or shed light on a story you're struggling to tell.</p>

            <p>The Storyteller's Dictionary is written using language that addresses writers of prose fiction, particularly novelists. This is purely for the sake of consistency and clarity&mdash;you can imagine how tiring it would be to read "novel/screenplay/short story/TV script/etc" several times on every page. You should be able to swap out the appropriate words to whichever medium you choose and the concepts will still apply.</p>

            <p>There will be spoilers.</p>
