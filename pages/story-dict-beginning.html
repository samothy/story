                  <br>
    
                  <p>The protagonist is the person at the center of your story. Even if they're not the viewpoint character, they will be the one driving the plot forward and also bearing the emotional weight.</p>
    
                  <p>In the words of the great Anton Ego, "Not everyone can become a great protagonist, but a great protagonist can come from anywhere." They might be noble and admirable or they might be dark and edgy, but the one thing that all great protagonists have in common is that they have serious, serious problems.</p>

                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>The Flawless Protagonist</h5>
    
                  <br>
    
                  <p>What happens if your character has no flaws whatsoever?</p>
    
                  <p>When devising the character that's going to inhabit the spotlight of your story, the temptation may be to make them as idealized as possible. The real world is filled with imperfect people and heroes are supposed to be better. How is a reader supposed to root for a character whose defects are so close to the surface?</p>
    
                  <p>The temptation is understandable, but having an untouchable protagonist will only remove the tension from your story. Such a character can only serve as wish fulfillment and, contrary to popular belief, this is not what stories are for.</p>
    
                  <p>Let me put it this way: if your character is both morally sound and omnipotent, producing tension is a Catch-22. Any normal obstacles will be a breeze, which is no fun to watch. The only thing that can pose a threat is an even more powerful entity, and in that case your character has no room to improve in order to meet this threat. This is part of why <a href='#superman-movies'>Superman movies always suck.</a></p>
    
                  <p>With a well-rounded protagonist, their core flaw is the one thing that puts them at a disadvantage against their antagonist. It acts as a handicap that stops the plot from being resolved immediately. After your protagonist gets beaten down and all hope seems lost (and they finally have no choice but to change), they grow. They can return to battle with their new strengths and finally overcome their opposition. Is this starting to sound familiar?</p>
    
                  <p>The protagonist's flaw is the story. Don't be afraid to really mess them up in the head. They're going to get better, and so is your story.</p>
    
                  <hr>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>What Is a Core Flaw?</h5>
    
                  <br>
    
                  <p>The main character is going to have many flaws, but one will rise above the others to define both the character of your protagonist and the narrative shape of your story as a whole.</p>
    
                  <p>Not just any flaw will do for this purpose.</p>
    
                  <p>This is one of the few situations where I will be adamant about a rule. A compelling, story-carrying flaw adheres to not one but all three of the following characteristics:</p>
    
                  <ol>
                    <li>The flaw is dangerous and unsustainable. It damages the protagonist's relationships and/or is detrimental to their life in other ways. If they don't address this flaw soon, they will face serious consequences.</li>
                    <li>The protagonist has the ability to fix this flaw if they wanted to. They <em>don't</em> want to, and invariably will choose not to change, but changing is within their power from the moment we meet them.</li>
                    <li>The flaw is internal to the protagonist and not imposed from the outside. In other words, it is a result of their own choices and not the actions of others or forces of nature.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Again, the temptation is going to be to ignore the "external" aspect and plague your protagonist with enemies and obstacles. They have an oppressive family. They survive sexual assault. Their boss is an asshole. Don't get me wrong, there should be enemies and obstacles and there's nothing inherently wrong with including these external forces. But without an internal flaw this just makes your main character a victim, which makes a sympathetic figure but not a compelling one. Does the story end as soon as the protagonist gives his boss the finger?</p>

                  <p>If at all possible, give these external threats an internal analog. This way, when your protagonist overcomes them it really feels like they grew as a person and earned the victory. The reader is going to feel this even if they don't register it consciously and it will add emotional weight to your narrative. Here are some examples:</p>
    
                  <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                      <tr>

                        <td>Trauma. This is something imposed from the outside and not inherently a reflection of the protagonist's character.</td>
                        <td>An unhealthy response to trauma that is harmful to themselves or the people around them.</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Being too noble and virtuous. They stand up for people they care about and are punished. This is especially common in YA.</td>
                        <td>Being noble for the wrong reasons; glory, "the greater good," etc.</td>
                      </tr>

                  <p>Your protagonist is an idiot.</p>
    
                  <p>Don't worry &mdash; that's a good thing. You <em>want</em> them to be an idiot. Even if this character's IQ is higher than their credit score (and believe me, they're <em>very</em> fiscally responsible), they're an idiot. It's not hyperbole to say that if they weren't an idiot there would be no story at all.</p>
    
                  <p>Humans have blind spots. We have flaws that we don't like addressing, because change is painful and we'll do just about anything to stay problematic. There's a disconnect, something separating us from being happy and fulfilled, but we're famously bad at identifying the cause. The problem invariably comes from inside our own heads, but we keep pointing the finger at external things like prizes to win and enemies to vanquish.</p>
                  
                  <p>What is your protagonist's deepest, most precious desire? What's the one thing that makes them think, "If I did this, I could finally be happy?" <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="Even if they do get it, it'll most likely be somewhere in The Middle and not the climax where you might expect.">This desire is misguided</span> &mdash; it's a product of the aforementioned blind spot. But if the protagonist knew that right out of the gate, it would be a very short and boring story. Change is painful and a person will only do it if <em>not</em> changing is even more painful. Show the reader exactly how much pain it's going to take to make your protagonist wake up and face their own shortcomings and voila, you have a story.</p>
    
                  <p>I imagine you have two concerns at this point.</p>
    
                  <p>1. This feels like putting the cart before the horse. First we were talking about the protagonist and now you want me to map out the whole story? In the <em>first bullet point of the entire Three-Act Structure?</em></p>
    
                  <p>Don't worry; we're not even done talking about the main character yet. There's plenty more to say and we'll discuss the finer points of plot structure in gritty detail. But the importance of the protagonist's flaw cannot be overstated, and it's something well worth thinking about as you decide the kind of story you want to tell.</p>
    
                  <p>2. If you thought, "Showing the protagonist the error of their ways is great and all, but surely that's not all a story is," you'd be absolutely right. Good stories (in the Western world, at least) do countless other things to transport us to another world. But the theme is what <em>every</em> good Western story does, and the theme stems from your protagonist.</p>

                <h6 class="subsection-header" id='three-pillars'>3. The Three Pillars</h6>
    
                <br>
    
                  <p>If the reader is going to follow your protagonist for hundreds of pages, they need to be fascinating. The audience needs to be on pins and needles wondering what the hero is going to do next. Thankfully there's something of a formula for making a character that will keep a reader turning the pages. A compelling character has the following qualities:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>Likeable</li>
                    <li>Competent</li>
                    <li>Proactive</li>
                  </ul>
    
                  <p>Simple, right? Now we just have to get rid of one.</p>
    
                  <p>It's <em>possible</em> to have a fascinating character with all three pillars intact, but it's difficult. We know already that a character's flaws are intrinsically tied with the emotional core of the story, and it's harder to believe that a character who's good at everything has a deep enough flaw.</p>
                  
                  <hr>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Proactive</h5>
                  <p>Let's assume you won't be touching the "proactive" pillar. We learned earlier that a character's desires are what fuel the story. If your protagonist doesn't have some get-up-and-go then why are they the center of the narrative at all? As always, there are some possible exceptions, but if you don't nail it the protagonist is going to be carried along by your story instead of carrying it themselves. Reacting is the audience's job and they don't need someone to show them how to do it. So if we're being honest, the list looks more like this:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>Likeable</li>
                    <li>Competent</li>
                    <li><strike>Proactive</strike></li>
                  </ul>
    
                  <p>That leaves two options. Do you make your character repulsive or do you make them useless? If this seems like a bad start to the person who's going to be at the center of an epic story, now is a good time to mention that these pillars are really more like sliders on your protagonist's dashboard. They're not fixed and can change as the story progresses. It's even possible that there will be times when your character will become less proactive &mdash; but there's a specific part of the story where that's particularly effective and we'll get to that later.</p>
    
                  <hr>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Competent</h5>
    
                  <p>The obvious archetype for someone with low competence is the underdog, which affords countless narrative opportunities. The underdog is someone that the audience can relate to very quickly because powerlessness is a feeling that everyone can understand. Mulan comes to mind as an example; she flounders both as a fighter and as a woman-in-disguise, but we still want to know what she'll do next because she's proactive as hell. Her competence slider gets dragged upwards during the "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" montage, but that's not the Mulan we meet in Act I.</p>
    
                  <p>A related but subtly different option is the fish-out-of-water: somebody who's competent in their Act I world but forced into an Act II where their skills are useless. Consider Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) in <em>Liar Liar</em>. He's successful as a lawyer because of his talent at bending the truth, but his "competent" pillar crumbles in Act II when his ability to lie is taken from him.</p>
    
                  <hr>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Likeable</h5>
    
                  <p>Breaking down this pillar is my personal preferred technique for making an interesting protagonist. There's been a long and successful string of ethically-challenged TV protagonists that we love to hate. Walter White, Don Draper, Tony Soprano, Frank Underwood. What they all have in common is that we know they're bad, but we can't stop watching because they're just too damn interesting. We need to know what they'll do next.</p>
                  
                  <p>A reprehensible protagonist also kills two birds with one stone by having their core flaw right out there in the open. If your character is too likeable, you'll have to do more work to prove that they have something wrong with them. We don't need to be told that something is wrong with Walter White.</p>
    
                  <hr>
    
                  <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Fan-Favorite Villains</h5>
    
                  <p>Villains will sometimes overshadow their protagonist and become the driving force of a story. This happens because villains, by definition, need to be both competent and proactive. Otherwise they're not a threat, they're just a person who happens to disagree with the good guys. This means that if you accidentally sprinkle in some charisma, they're going to have three strong pillars and dominate the scene.</p>
                  
                  <p>This happens most often in long TV shows where characters go through numerous different arcs. Villains are redeemed on TV much more frequently than in any other medium, where viewer preferences affect ratings and therefore have a larger impact on the course of the story. To avoid the story revolving around this former villain, what usually happens is that the source of their power is taken away, leaving an enthusiastic and sympathetic helper.</p>
    
                  <p>If you find that scenes involving your villain are way more interesting than the ones with your hero, you might want to sit back and do some thinking. First look at the protagonist and make sure that one or more of their pillars <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="The ones that you didn't remove intentionally, that is.">aren't missing</span>. However, you may also need to consider the possibility that your "antagonist" is actually the center of the story.</p>
    
                <hr>
    
                <h6 class="subsection-header" id='theme-stated'>4. Theme Stated</h6>
    
                <br>
    
                  <p>Yes, this is one of the beats in Blake Snyder's formula, but it's so interesting and important that I couldn't help but include it.</p>
    
                  <p>At this point, the reader knows that your protagonist has a flaw. The other characters in the story also know that the protagonist has a flaw. In fact this flaw is probably hurting them directly. The only one who doesn't know about the protagonist's flaw is the protagonist themself.</p>
    
                  <p>In Act I, one of these supporting characters will try to fix that. They're going to confront the protagonist and tell them what's wrong with their worldview. Sometimes this is done more subtly than others, but it's always there.</p>
    
                  <p>The great part about this beat is that it means the protagonist has the answer to their problem from the very beginning. They could prevent all the trials and suffering that the rest of the story has for them if they just listen to this intervention. But their desire is too strong and they'll brush off the advice.</p>
    
                  <p>This seems like an bizarre thing for <em>every</em> story to have. Surely some subset of protagonists would be smart enough to take the advice if it was given right to their face and the tension would be ruined if they were confronted by someone they trust. But change is painful, remember? At this point in the story, not-changing is still more comfortable than changing. Even if the protagonist loves this supporting character (common), and they believe this supporting character when the issue is brought up (uncommon), the desire to achieve their goals is too strong. They'll come up with excuses.</p>
    
                  <p>Not only is this universal, but it also produces some of the most memorable lines in storytelling. A mere handful of examples:</p>
    
                  <ul>
                    <li>"With great power comes great responsibility."</li>
                    <li>"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Okay okay, we've done all the fancy-pants background work. Can we <em>finally</em> start writing now?</p>

                  <p>Yes, we're ready to jump into the opening scene and make first contact with the reader. But, as usual, I need to back up first.</p>
    
                  <p>When a reader picks up a book, they enter an unwritten and unspoken contract with the author. The reader offers their time, which is a precious and irretrievable resource. This is on the understanding that the author is going to make that sacrifice worthwhile.</p>

                  <p>We can comfortably say that the author is expected to provide entertainment. We, the audience, choose stories in order to be delighted. But this isn't all, is it? The stories that touched you, the ones you revisit once a year, they didn't merely entertain you. They forged an emotional connection. They tricked you into caring for people that don't exist. They showed you the best and worst parts of humanity. Plus the explosions and boobs and other things that make it into the trailer.</p>

                  <p>Without the emotional connection, the entertainment feels hollow and meaningless. Without the entertainment, the audience won't stick around long enough to make the emotional connection &mdash; and even if they do, it will feel like a sermon instead of a story.</p>
