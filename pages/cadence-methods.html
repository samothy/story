                <p>The quote above represents the most common and the most compelling argument against the Three-Act Structure: it can only be applied from outside of a story. It's a series of labels slapped on <em>post-facto</em>. In other words, the Three-Act Structre is a skeleton at best and a butcher's diagram at worst, useful for consumption and analysis but ignorant of the moving, organic elements that actually bring a story to life.</p>

                <p>I agree with this criticism 100%, and this section is an effort to counteract the cold lifelessness of the rigid structure we've been leaning on thus far. I call the following methods "cadence methods" because they act like the ebb and flow relationship that's so ubiquitous in nature and living things.</p>

                <p>At the risk of sounding grandiose, a story is a living thing that's kept alive by an overlapping web of give-and-take patterns, much the same as respiration and bloodflow and countless other systems keep us alive. Most of the time you won't need to think about applying these to your story&mdash;dont underestimate your intuition as a storytelling creature. But if you feel stuck, taking a look through this section may help you get out of the rut and restore some focus.</p>

                    <p>Nature operates in cadences: moon phases, ocean tides, the changing of the seasons. Living things have their own cadences too. Circadian rhythms, reproductive cycles, hibernation, inhaling and exhaling. This ebb and flow relationship is reflected in storytelling.</p>
    
                    <p>Actions have consequences and events inevitably lead to others. Understanding how to control the flow of your story will give it a vitality that the Three-Act Structure alone can't provide.</p>

                        <p>The quote is a chapter title, but it might as well be the subtitle of <em>The Hobbit</em> because it perfectly captures the essence of not only this story but all good adventure stories. The characters are immersed in a dangerous situation and forced to extract themselves using only their wits and whatever tools they have on hand. However, by evading one enemy Bilbo and the dwarves immediately find themselves facing something else.</p>
    
                        <p>This first cadence method is powerful because it grips the audience immediately. You show the audience how stacked the odds are against the protagonist(s), the stakes if they fail, and then let the protagonist find their way out using their individual strengths.
    
                    <hr>
    
                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Immersion</h5>

                        <p>The keys to a good Immersion are an adequate challenge and high stakes. The odds need to be stacked against the protagonist so that their success doesn't feel guaranteed. It should be conceivable that they'll drop the ball and fail, and maybe they even do. There should also be consequences for this failure that we know in advance, typically the death of the protagonist or someone they care about.</p>
                    
                        <p>In <em>Saw</em>, the two main characters wake up in a dingy bathroom chained to pipes. We don't even know their names yet, but our curiosity is piqued and we need our ever-increasing list of questions answered&mdash;first among them, how are these men going to get out of the room? Under the one overarching Immersion/Extraction umbrella are a handful of smaller problems that Adam and Dr. Gordon need to overcome in order to appease the Jigsaw Killer.</p>

                        <p>We don't need to spend time explaining what the stakes are or why we should care. The audience understands immediately that the characters' lives are in danger. </p>
    
                        <p>The quagmires and battles your characters face aren't random; the way that one problem is solved leads directly to the next problem in a trackable way. We'll talk about this more in <a href='#therefore-but'>Therefore/But</a>.</p>
    
                    <hr>

                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Extraction</h5>

                        <p>When you immerse your characters in danger, they'll need some means of extracting themselves. They'll have a preferred way, one that they're proficient at: for example, Fletcher Reede lies in response to just about everything. This preferred method is usually tied to the protagonist's flaw and it's a good idea to show them doing this once or twice in The Beginning.</p>

                        <p>But it would get boring to watch a character solve problems the same way for the duration of an entire story. The Middle is all about putting the protagonist in a topsy-turvy world that they don't understand yet. The obvious recourse here is to nullify the protagonist's superpower somehow, either by straight-up taking it away (<em>Liar Liar</em>) or by introducing a threat that's impervious to it (example here).</p>

                        <p>What this is going to do is force your protagonist to think outside the box and figure out new ways to confront problems. This is a great way to create tension and also begins to point your protagonist toward their own flaw.</p>

                <h4 class='chapter-title' id='therefore-but'>Chapter X: Therefore/But</h4>
    
                    <br>
    
                    <p>This method was invented by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of <em>South Park</em>. The premise is that a story can be represented by a single chain of events joined together by the alternating conjuntions THEREFORE and BUT. This has two important effects:</p>
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Every action has a consequence, and these consequences beget more action. There's a cause-and-effect relationship that makes the plot feel natural and not arbitrary. The audience is excited to learn the unintented outcomes of the characters actions, and in retrospect these outcomes will seem inevitable.</li>
                        <li>This back-and-forth exchange creates an escalation. When the protagonist is faced with a dilemma and makes a decision (typically either the wrong one or one that comes at a great cost), the stakes don't go <em>down</em>. The negative consequences stack up and carry the story towards The End, where everything culminates.</li>
                    </ol>
    
                    <p>The important thing here is the use of these two specific conjunctions. "And then" doesn't appear at the beginning of any plot beat, because "and then" doesn't imply anything about where to go next. Therefore and But have built-in tension and conflict. It emphasizes the idea that the suffering of the protagonist comes largely as a byproduct of their own decisions.</p>

                          <h5 class='card-subtitle'>A paragraph that turned into a box-sized digression</h5>
                          <hr>
                          
                          <p class="card-text">The goal of the Therefore/But cadence method is to create the illusion that the events of your story couldn't have unfolded any other way. Because of the deep-seated traits of your characters, the outcomes (good and bad) are simultaneously believable but heartbreaking. This is dramatically powerful, representing a resistance to the <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='top' title="We have a hard time feeling sympathy for anything non-human, and the decision to split up when faced with a threat is not a human one. The character deaths feel pointless and gimmicky because the obvious alternative is the characters working together. In other words, the outcome was not inevitable."><em>Let's Split Up!</em> trope that makes many horror movies so frustrating</span>. You <em>want</em> this sense of inevitability. The tricky part, then, can sometimes be achieving this without becoming predictable. After all, once the reader has no more questions left to answer, they put down the book.</p>
    
                          <p class="card-text">Inevitability doesn't need to be equal to predictability. Chances are, you don't even need to go out of your way to keep your reader in the dark. The answer to the riddle feels obvious to you because the story resides in your brain in its entirety. You're immersed inside the idea and can see all the angles of it. The reader can only know what's on the page and there's never as much information there as you (the author) think. Intentional misdirection is bound to be overkill.</p>
                          
                          <p>The ultimate insult to predictability is the plot twist: the lightning bolt of revelation that unlocks one or more mysteries in an instant. These are greatly tempting to writers, especially new ones, and usually not for good reasons. The plot twist is overrated, plain and simple.</p>
    
                          <p>Firstly, consider the fact that we still enjoy books and movies we've consumed already. We know everything that's going to happen, and yet even stories with notoriously shocking and subversive twists retain their value a second time and beyond. What this demonstrates is that a good twist can be interesting and there's no reason <em>not</em> to include one, but a big reveal is not enough to carry a story on its own. Instead it is a byproduct of a tightly-knit and well-constructed story.</p>
    
                          <p>If you start with the plot twist and work backwards, the result is going to be deceptive and that's a no-no. Deceiving the reader for its own sake is not only self-indulgent (face it, what you really want is to show off how clever you are), but it also represents a violation of the <a href='#'>promises we make as storytellers.</a> This kind of twist no longer feels clever, only disingenuous.</p>
                          
                          <p>Don't get me wrong, there will be things that you withhold from the reader. This is part of the the game that both the author and the audience signed up for, particularly in the realm of thrillers and mysteries. But to put it simply, when you hide the answer you have to plainly state the riddle. Otherwise you're winning a game against somebody who doesn't even know they're playing. If the reader can't conceivably piece together your mystery before you reveal it on the page, the twist will not only be weak but underhanded. The power of a twist doesn't come from how well-concealed it was. In fact, the power comes from how <em>obvious</em> it is in retrospect. When you drop the curtain, your reader should think "Oh, duh! How did I not see that? The evidence was there all along."</p>

                    <p>While it's the high-intensity scenes that usually draw us to the story, they also become tiring if there's too much adrenaline for too long. Both the characters and the reader need time to process what just happened and plan for what comes next. If you've seen any of the <em>Transformers</em> movies, you may notice that you don't remember a damn thing about them. Every frame is crowded and dynamic and the audience never has time to commit any of it to memory before the next thing comes along.</p>
    
                    <p>The "Action" part doesn't need to be Jason Bourne jumping through a window and killing a man with a ballpoint pen. If the characters don't have the bandwidth to talk about anything except what's currently happening, that's the Action part. This can be dialogue-based, such as an interrogation or negotiation, if the scene is tense enough.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once the action is over, they're allowed to slow down and talk about anything they want&mdash;usually each others' backstories and whatnot. Besides giving the reader a break, it would also be inappropriate to ask somebody if their fear of commitment stems from their relationship to their father if that person is struggling not to be killed with a ballpoint pen. The "Dialogue" part is where the emotional and psychological aspects of your theme can be deeply explored.</p>

                    <p>Things to consider when creating a "dialogue" scene:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li class='mb-2'>Scenes usually need to serve more than one purpose, so a scene where two characters <em>only</em> have a conversation will usually feel extraneous and fluffy. Often characters will have a chat while waiting for or traveling between "real" scenes. The bottom line is that exposition is necessary,  but you shouldn't jeopardize the momentum of your story for it. See <a href='#'>Efficiency of Storytelling</a>.</li>

                        <li class='mb-2'>Related to the last point: dialogue in stories doesn't behave like conversations in real life. It might <em>sound</em> natural and emulate the way that people talk, but dialogue always serves a story purpose. In other words, humans in real life may talk just to pass the time or fill the silence. Characters never will. Conflict needs to be present. Here are some reasons characters in a story might have a conversation about a sports game:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li class='m-2'>A third character who doesn't like sports feels alienated because they can't participate.</li>
                                <li class='m-2'>The conversation is intentionally awkward, demonstrating that sports are the only thing that these two have in common.</li>
                                <li class='m-2'>Both the storyteller and the audience both know the conversation is boring, and this serves to establish a frustratingly mundane world (such <em>Office Space</em> or <em>Groundhog Day</em>). In this case, make a point of showing your protagonist's disdain.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li></li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In a word: foreshadowing.</p>

                    <p>We've already seen a form of the Setup/Payoff method in the form of the <a href='#'>Theme Stated</a>; a secondary character tells the protagonist what's wrong with them and the protagonist doesn't listen. The remainder of the story exists to show that the secondary character was right.</p> 
                    
                    <p>A good Setup prevents a <em>Deus Ex Machina</em> situation where your protagonist magically has the solution to a problem, or a <em>Diabolus Ex Machina</em> wherein the villain magically gets their way instead. As we saw with plot twists earlier, the power of the Payoff comes from a good, thorough Setup.</p>

                      <p>A gun is well-suited as an example because it's a very potent story element. Our attention is instantly piqued when a firearm is mentioned. It has a threatening presence on the page and the reader is going to make a note of it.</p>

                      <p>This ties back into <a href='#'>Author's Promises</a>&mdash;there's an implicit agreement that if you put something on the page, it had better be important because the reader has to spend some amount of time and brainpower on it.</p>

                      <p>Ernest Hemingway famously disagreed, believing that there's no harm in inconsequential details as long as they contribute to the overall experience of the story. Hemingway has a point and you shouldn't be afraid to include details that add flavor, but there are two things you should consider:</p>
