                <p>The Middle is where most writers find themselves stumped. Their momentum fails, their characters become aimless and indecisive, and the bridge between The Beginning and The End seems impossible to visualize.</p>

                <p>John Truby's quote above represents the most viable criticism of the Three-Act Structure; any descriptive story structure can only come from the outside, slapped on <em>post-facto</em>. The result is a a skeleton at best and a butcher's chart at worst &mdash; in other words, the Three-Act Structure is useful to the consumer and the analyst but ignores the moving parts of a story that bring it to life.</p>

                <p>This criticism is spot-on, and I've gathered some methods that help turn the skeleton into something more organic. Of course, there's no method that can fully explain how to make a vibrant and soulful story (if you figure it out, let me know), but there are some tools you can use if you feel stuck.</p>

            <h6 class='subsection-header' id='right-thing-wrong-way'>1. Doing the Right Thing the Wrong Way</h6>

                <br>

                <p>While I tend to think of The Middle as two parts with one major event smack in the middle, both of these parts are serving the same narrative purpose so it still makes sense to just call it all "The Middle." We'll talk more about the two distinct sections later.</p>

                <p>But first, what is this singular purpose that defines The Middle?</p>
                
                <p>The Middle is where your protagonist is focused on their external goal, whatever that may be. The sports championship, the ancient artifact, the attractive co-star, or maybe even just survival. There will be many smaller objectives along the way, but always with a singular ultimate intent. This is the part of the movie that the trailer focuses on, usually. Explosions and kisses and all the other exciting things that made us pick this story in the first place.</p>

                <p>But the protagonist doesn't <em>need</em> the thing they're chasing in this part of the story. It is a product of, and a distraction from, the internal problem that they need to solve. This is why we say they're doing things "the wrong way." They're circling the issue at hand but refusing to see it.</p>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>The Genius of <em>My Name Is Earl</em></h5>

                <br>

                <p>The show <em>My Name Is Earl</em> is a wonderful example of this concept. In every episode, former menace to society Earl Hickey picks one item from a list of all the bad things he's done in his life and aims to get right with whoever he hurt. Each of these individual missions contributes to the overall goal of fixing his karma &mdash; therefore allowing good things to happen to him.</p>

                <p>The genius of this show is that both the episode goals and the overall series goal are external objectives that hide the real prize: becoming a better person. Throughout the course of the show, Earl learns that by making amends with the victims of his many crimes to make good things happen to himself, what he's really doing is elevating himself as a human <em>for its own sake.</em></p>

                <p>On the episode level, <em>My Name Is Earl</em> makes concrete examples of this abstract concept. In the pilot episode, Earl wants to help Kenny, a man whom he bullied in grade school. When Earl and his brother Randy discover that Kenny lives alone, they resolve to get him a girlfriend. This is a problem because it turns out Kenny is gay. In the end, what Earl and Randy really have to do is overcome their homophobia and take Kenny to a gay bar, something he's too afraid to do on his own.</p>

                <p>Earl <em>wants</em> to make up for bullying Kenny, but he <em>needs</em> to address his bigotry. This is the formula that every subsequent episode follows. Earl and Randy set out with an actionable plan to do something external which ultimately leads Earl to fix something about himself.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not gushing about <em>My Name Is Earl</em> just because it's an amazing show (which it is), but because it demonstrates in a very concise way something that all stories do. This dichotomy between the wants and needs of your protagonist is explored all throughout The Middle and provides a great deal of the tension and conflict.</p>

                <p>In chasing the goal they picked in The Beginning, your protagonist is going to reveal the worst parts of themselves. They're going to jeopardize everything to reach it, even if that means deceiving and betraying the people closest to them.</p>
                
                <p>In short, don't be afraid to make your protagonist do horrible things in the name of conquest. They're going to have plenty of time to do the admirable things later on. For now, they need to be ruthlessly focused on the external thing they want.</p>

                <p>Nature operates in cadences: moon phases, ocean tides, the changing of the seasons. Living things have their own cadences too. Circadian rhythms, reproductive cycles, hibernation, inhaling and exhaling. There's an ebb and flow relationship in nature that is reflected in storytelling.</p>

                <p>Actions have consequences, and events inevitably lead to others. Understanding how to control the flow of your story will give it a vitality that the Three-Act Structure alone can't provide.</p>

                <p>These will be of particular interest to <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='right' title="Whereas planners like to see the shape of the story in advance, pantsers prefer to see no further than their headlights when writing.

These methods help avoid writing yourself into a corner or otherwise fizzling out.</p>

                <p>The quote is a chapter title, but it might as well be the subtitle of <em>The Hobbit</em> because it perfectly captures the essence of not only this story but all good adventure stories. The characters are immersed in a dangerous situation and forced to extract themselves using only their wits and whatever tools they have on hand. However, by evading one enemy Bilbo and the dwarves immediately find themselves facing something else.</p>

                <p>This method is powerful because it grips the audience immediately. In <em>Saw</em>, the two main characters wake up in a dingy bathroom chained to pipes. We don't even know their names yet, but our curiosity is piqued and we need our ever-increasing list of questions answered. Primarily, how are they going to extract themselves from this room? Under the one overarching Immersion/Extraction umbrella are a handful of smaller problems that Adam and Dr. Gordon need to overcome in order to appease the Jigsaw Killer.</p>

                <p>The quagmires and battles your characters face aren't random; the way that one problem is solved leads directly to the next problem in a trackable way. This leads us to the next method:</p>

                <hr>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Therefore/But</h5>

                <br>

                <p>This method was invented by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of <em>South Park</em>. The premise is that a story can be represented by a single chain of events joined together by the alternating conjuntions THEREFORE and BUT. This has two important effects:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Every action has a consequence, and these consequences beget more action. There's a cause-and-effect relationship that makes the plot feel natural and not arbitrary. The audience is excited to learn the unintented outcomes of the characters actions, and in retrospect these outcomes will seem inevitable.</li>
                    <li>This back-and-forth exchange creates an escalation. When the protagonist is faced with a dilemma and makes a decision (typically either the wrong one or one that comes at a great cost), the stakes don't go <em>down</em>. The negative consequences stack up and carry the story towards The End, where everything culminates.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The important thing here is the use of these two specific conjunctions. "And then" doesn't appear at the beginning of any plot beat, because "and then" doesn't imply anything about where to go next. Therefore and But have built-in tension and conflict.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-body">
                      <h4 class="card-title">The Inevitability of Plot</h4>
                      <hr>
                      

                      <p class="card-text">The goal of the Therefore/But cadence method is to ensure that the outcomes of your story, both the good and the bad, feel inevitable. Because of your characters' personalities and the rules of the world, there's no other way that the sequence of events could have unfolded. This is dramatically powerful, representing the opposite of the <span class='tool' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='bottom' title="We have a hard time feeling sympathy for anything non-human, and the decision to split up when faced with a threat is not a human one. The character deaths feel pointless and gimmicky because the obvious alternative is the characters working together. In other words, the outcome was not inevitable."><em>Let's Split Up!</em> trope that makes many horror movies so frustrating</span>. You <em>want</em> this sense of inevitability. The tricky part, then, can sometimes be achieving this without becoming predictable. After all, once the reader has no more questions left to answer, they put down the book.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Inevitability is not inherently equal to predictability. You probably don't need to go out of your way to obscure the future from your reader. Don't get me wrong, a predictable story is virtually unreadable. the outcomes may feel obvious to you because the story resides in your brain in its entirety. You're immersed inside the idea and can see all the angles of it. The reader only knows what's on the page and you're the one putting words on it.</p>
                      
                      <p>On the other end of the predictability spectrum is the plot twist, a lightning bolt of revelation that unlocks one or more mysteries in an instant. These are greatly tempting to writers, especially new ones, because twists are often what we remember from books and movies. But the twist is overrated, plain and simple.</p>

                      <p>Firstly, consider the fact that we still enjoy books and movies we've consumed already. We know everything that's going to happen, and yet the story still provides value. Even stories with famously shocking twists aren't ruined by our knowledge. This is the power of the tightly-knit, <em>inevitable</em> story. The revelation is only as interesting as the work you put in to set it up.</p>

                      <p>Writing purely to set up a twist will create a hollow story indeed. Without the groundwork and foreshadowing all we do is deceive the reader, which is a violation of the <a href='#'>promises we made to our audience.</a> Part of the teamwork between author and reader involves hiding things from them. This is the game we play, especially with mysteries. But these hidden things must be suggested on the page in order to leave some work for the reader to do. Hide the answer but show the riddle. The reader needs to know that the game has been initiated. If the reader can't conceivably piece together your mystery before you reveal it on the page, the twist will feel cheap and arbitrary. The power of a twist doesn't come from how unexpected it is, but from how obvious it is once you see it. Duh! Suddenly everything makes sense.</p>

                      <p>Inevitability. See?</p>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Action/Dialogue</h5>

                <p>While it's the high-intensity scenes that usually draw us to the story, they also become tiring if there's too much adrenaline for too long. Both the characters and the reader need time to process what just happened and plan for what comes next. If you've seen any of the Transformers movies, you may notice that you don't remember a damn thing about them. Every frame is crowded and dynamic and the audience never has time to commit any of it to memory before the next thing comes along.</p>

                <p>The "Action" of the Action/Dialogue dichotomy doesn't need to be Jason Bourne jumping through a window and killing a man with a book. If the characters don't have the bandwidth to talk about anything except what's currently happening, that's the Action part. Once the action is over, they're allowed to slow down and talk about anything they want&mdash;probably each others' backstories and other expository nonsense like that.</p>

                <p>Besides giving the reader a break, it would also be inappropriate to ask somebody if they think their fear of commitment stems from their relationship with their father if that person is struggling not to be killed with a book.</p>

                <br>
    
                <p>Let's take a break from the nuts and bolts to talk about something a little more abstract but no less important.</p>

                <p>Part of inducing the story trance is communicating your credibility to the audience. Why should a reader invest their time into your story in particular? What makes you qualified to be a storyteller?</p>
                
                <p>If you think about it, a printed book has credibility built right into it. Merely by nature of the fact that this story is in book form means that a publishing house thought the story was worth printing. There's a price on the cover that several entities along the production line thought was a fair amount to pay for the right to read this story. There's even an "About the Author" page listing the storyteller's accolades and titles. If they're a well-established author, the cover will also tell you what other stories they've told&mdash;thousands of people just like you already vetted this author. In other words, lots of other people have essentially made the decision already whether the author is qualified, and the answer is yes. All that's left is whether the story itself is to your taste.</p>

                <p>Okay, that's great and all. However, I'm not a published author. It's okay, there are other ways of telling a potential reader that you brought your A-game.</p>

                <p>Essentially it all boils down to taking yourself seriously. If you truly believe in your story and think an audience's time would be well spent on it, people will <em>feel</em> that. They will be unconsciously coaxed into the story state by the way the story itself is presented.</p>

                <hr>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Proofread</h5>
                  
                  <p>I know this seems obvious, but nothing is less conducive to a story state than sentence-level language problems. In imaginationland, anything can happen. Suspension of disbelief can convince me that a donkey can fly, but not that two exclamation points are appropriate.</p>

                  <p>Go over your story several times. Read it out loud. Show it to a friend. Anything to iron out the easily preventable mistakes. Don't give lazy critics any excuse to stop reading and force them to actually get into the meat of your story.</p>

                  <hr>
                
                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Don't Talk Bad About Yourself</h5>

                  <p>I see this a lot in self-published writing online. Wherever the website gives the author a chance to describe themselves or their work, there's almost always some element of self-deprecation. Usually they place emphasis on how little time it took to write or the odd hour at which it was written.</p>

                  <p>The temptation is easy to understand. Everyone wants to be the accidental genius whose throwaway works garner attention against their every expectation. Or perhaps the author is deathly afraid of criticism and believes the reviews will hurt less if they weren't really trying to begin with.</p>

                  <p>But if you're not trying then why should I click your link? You're trying to hook readers. Showcasing how little effort went in is a bad start.</p>

                  <p>Resist the urge to cushion yourself against negative feedback. It will come, and it will hurt, but you're a <em>storyteller</em>. You have something important to say. This story is imbued with the essence of the human experience and people want to read it, goddammit.</p>

                  <hr>

                <h5 class="h5-subhead">Avoid Cliches</h5>

                  <p>First, because the two often get confused, let's discuss the difference between cliches and tropes.</p>

                  <p>A trope is a shortcut that saves time for the reader, transmitting a lot of information about a story in not a lot of time. Used properly, a trope can be a tool to bring a reader right up to your wavelength.</p>

                  <p>A cliche is a shortcut that saves time for the <em>author</em>, and transmits very little information because of the lack of specificity.</p>

                  <p>By using a cliche, either at the conceptual level ("My two lead characters are in love but they can only show it by being mean to each other.") or at the language level ("<em>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</em>"), what you're saying is that your idea wasn't even important enough to come up with a new combination of words.</p>

                  <p>In short, don't be afraid to recycle a story element you find useful (steal like an artist, am I right?). But be honest with yourself about what is a creative re-working of an idea and what's just lazy.</p>

                  <hr>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Host Creatively</h5>

                  <p>If you post your writing online (or a webcomic, for that matter), buy a domain and put it there instead. You know, like I did. Surely I'm not biased on this.</p>

                  <p>Making a website seems like a hassle and maybe like overkill. If that's the case, re-evaluate your story and figure out why it doesn't deserve its own website. However, if you're just intimidated by the idea of web development itself, take a deep breath. You don't need to be a computer whiz to do such a thing these days. There are plenty of services that allow you to create highly customized sites with relative ease.</p>

                  <p>The main benefit of doing this is <em>instant credibility</em>. This person has a website with their name in the URL... they must be for real. If they thought their work deserved this kind of treatment then there must be something to it (They don't need to know that it costs about the same as a Netflix subscription).</p>

                  <p>If you're worried about getting traffic to your work, consider how much traffic you're currently getting. On submission-based platforms your work is thrown in with all the rest. The story next to yours could be spectacular (competing with you) or terrible (damaging your credibility by association). It may take some time to accumulate an audience, but they will be <em>yours.</em> They navigated to your site to read your work and nothing else.</p>

                  <p>If you're making video content, YouTube is probably still your best bet. But knock yourself out creating a website for the content that YouTube isn't great at (community engagement, author bio, event schedules, etc).</p>
