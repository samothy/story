                <p>The Middle is where most writers find themselves stumped. Their momentum fails, their characters become aimless and indecisive, and the bridge between The Beginning and The End seems impossible to visualize.</p>

                <p>John Truby's quote above suggests the most viable criticism of the Three-Act Structure (which is essentially what we're dealing with here); any descriptive story structure can only come from the outside, slapped on <em>post-facto</em>. The result is a skeleton at best and a butcher's chart at worst. Structure describes a story in a way that's useful to the consumer, ignoring the muscles, organs, and other messy but necessary processes that actually keep it alive and moving.</p>

                <p>Most troubles in The Middle stem from this kind of thinking, which is why this section will focus on the organic elements that make a story come to life.</p>

            <h6 class='subsection-header' id='right-thing-wrong-way'>1. Doing the Right Thing the Wrong Way</h6>

                <br>

                <p>While I tend to think of The Middle as two parts with one major event smack in the middle, both of these parts are serving the same narrative purpose so it still makes sense to just call it all "The Middle." We'll talk more about the two distinct sections later.</p>

                <p>But first, what is the purpose that defines The Middle? As the title suggests, The Middle is where your protagonist is focused on their external goal, whatever that may be. The sports championship, the ancient artifact, the attractive co-star, or maybe even just survival. There will be many smaller objectives along the way, but always with a singular ultimate intent. This is the part of the movie that the trailer focuses on, usually. Explosions and kisses and all the other exciting things that made us pick this story in the first place.</p>

                <p>But the protagonist doesn't <em>need</em> the thing they're chasing in this part of the story. It is a product of, and a distraction from, the internal problem that they need to solve. This is why we say they're doing things "the wrong way."</p>

                <p>The show <em>My Name Is Earl</em> is a wonderful example of this concept. In every episode, former menace to society Earl Hickey picks one item from a list of all the bad things he's done in his life and aims to get right with whoever he hurt. Each of these individual missions contributes to the overall goal of fixing his karma &mdash; therefore allowing good things to happen to him.</p>

                <p>The genius of this show is that both the episode goals and the overall series goal are external objectives that hide the real prize: becoming a better person. Throughout the course of the show, Earl learns that by making amends with the victims of his many crimes to make good things happen to himself, what he's really doing is becoming a better human for its own sake.</p>

                <p>On the episode level, <em>My Name Is Earl</em> makes concrete examples of this abstract concept. In the pilot episode, Earl wants to help Kenny, a man whom he bullied in grade school. When Earl and his brother Randy discover that Kenny lives alone, they resolve to get him a girlfriend. This is a problem because it turns out Kenny is gay. In the end, what Earl and Randy really have to do is overcome their homophobia and take Kenny to a gay bar, something he's too afraid to do on his own.</p>

                <p>Earl <em>wants</em> to make up for bullying Kenny, but he <em>needs</em> to address his bigotry. This is the formula for every episode of the show &mdash; Earl and Randy set out with an actionable plan to do something external which ultimately leads Earl to fix something internal.</p>

                <p>I'm not gushing about <em>My Name Is Earl</em> just because it's an amazing show (which it is), but because it's an excellent example of something that all stories do. This dichotomy between the wants and needs of your protagonist is explored all throughout The Middle and provides a great deal of the tension and conflict.</p>

                <p>In chasing the goal they picked in The Beginning, your protagonist is going to reveal the worst parts of themselves. They're going to jeopardize everything to reach it, even if that means deceiving and betraying the people closest to them.</p>
                
                <p>In short, don't be afraid to make your protagonist do horrible things in the name of conquest. They're going to have plenty of time to do the admirable things later on. For now, they need to be ruthlessly focused on the external thing they want.</p>

                <p>The quote is a chapter title, but it might as well be the subtitle of <em>The Hobbit</em> because it captures the essence of any adventure story. The characters are immersed in a dangerous situation and forced to extract themselves using whatever tools they have on hand. However, by evading one enemy Bilbo and the dwarves immediately find themselves facing something else.</p>

                <p>This method is powerful because it grips the audience immediately. In <em>Saw</em>, the two main characters wake up in a dingy bathroom chained to pipes. We don't even know their names yet, but our curiosity is piqued and we need our ever-increasing list of questions answered. Primarily, how are they going to extract themselves from this room? Under the one Immersion/Extraction umbrella are a handful of smaller problems that Adam and Dr. Gordon need to overcome in order to appease the Jigsaw Killer.</p>

                <p>The quagmires and battles aren't random, but connected to each other and dependent on the way that your characters choose to extract themselves. This leads us to the next method:</p>

                <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Therefore/But</h5>

                <br>

                <p>I believe this method was invented by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of <em>South Park</em>. The premise is that between every scene, you should be able to alternate the words Therefore and But.</p>

                <div class="jumbotron">

                    <h1>Therefore/But</h1>

                    <p>Cobb is a nerdy high school student who wants his popular classmates to think he's cool.</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>Cobb enters the school's talent show, which he overheard his crush Chelsea talking about.</p>

                    <p>BUT</p>

                    <p>Cobb doesn't actually have a talent.</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>He strikes a deal with a demon who offers him unbeatable talent.</p>
                    
                    <p>BUT</p>
                
                    <p>In exchange, the demon expects non-specific "favors."</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE</p>

                    <p>Cobb's classmates start to be intrigued by him, seeing evidence of his new skills.</p>

                    <p>BUT</p>
                </div>

                <p>This is obviously a pretty cheesy premise for a story, but it does demonstrate the power of the two prepositions. </p>
