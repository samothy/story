                    <p>The Middle is where your protagonist is focused on their external goal, whatever that may be. Sports championships, ancient artifacts, cute co-stars, or maybe even just survival. There will be many smaller objectives along the way but these are all stepping stones on the way towards the singular prize. This is the part of the movie that the trailer focuses on, usually. When someone asks what your story is about, your answer will usually be about The Middle Pt. 1.</p>

                    <p>Here's the good news: Your protagonist is self-aware enough to know that something has to change and they're willing to put in the work to do it. The bad news is that this is the extent of their self-awareness.</p>
    
                    <p>The protagonist doesn't <em>need</em> whatever it is they're chasing in this part of the story. You've got to drill into the irony that's already buried in this concept. The protagonist's flaw is what makes the goal seem so important, and the goal is also a distraction that allows them to willfully ignore the flaw. And to top it all off, the pursuit of this goal is also the very thing that's going to bring the protagonist down to rock bottom and force them to confront their core problem (we'll talk more about this in Pt. 2)  The hero dances around the real answer to their problem for most of the story and simply refuses to see it.</p>

                    <h5 class='h5-subhead'>Why <em>My Name Is Earl</em> Is An Amazing Show</h5>
    
                    <br>
    
                    <p>The show <em>My Name Is Earl</em> is a wonderful example of this concept. In every episode, former menace to society Earl Hickey picks one item from a list of all the bad things he's done in his life and aims to get right with whoever he hurt. Each of these individual missions contributes to the overall goal of fixing his karma &mdash; therefore allowing good things to happen to him.</p>
    
                    <p>The genius of this show is that both the episode goals and the overall series goal are external objectives that hide the real prize: becoming a better person. Throughout the course of the show, Earl learns that by making amends with the victims of his many crimes to make good things happen to himself, what he's really doing is elevating himself as a human <em>for its own sake.</em></p>
    
                    <p>On the episode level, <em>My Name Is Earl</em> makes concrete examples of this abstract concept. In the pilot episode Earl wants to help Kenny, a man he bullied when the two were in grade school. When Earl and his brother Randy discover that Kenny lives alone, they resolve to get him a girlfriend. This is a problem because it turns out Kenny is gay. In the end, what Earl and Randy really have to do is overcome their homophobia and take Kenny to a gay bar, something he's too afraid to do on his own.</p>
    
                    <p>Earl <em>wants</em> to make up for bullying Kenny, but he <em>needs</em> to address his bigotry. This is the formula that every subsequent episode follows. Earl and Randy set out with an actionable plan to do something external which ultimately leads Earl to fix something about himself.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm not gushing about <em>My Name Is Earl</em> just because it's an amazing show (which it is), but because it demonstrates in a very concise way something that all stories do. This dichotomy between the wants and needs of your protagonist is explored all throughout The Middle and provides a great deal of the tension and conflict.</p>
    
                    <hr>
    
                    <h5 class="h5-subhead">Your Protagonist is a Bad Person (For Now)</h5>
    
                    <p><em>My Name Is Earl</em> is a comedy show, so the misguided decisions made by the characters are generally low stakes. There's rarely a consequence that can't be resolved by the end of the half hour. But this doesn't need to be the case at all &mdash; you can be far crueler.</p>
    
                    <p>In chasing the goal they picked in The Beginning, your protagonist is going to reveal the worst parts of themselves. They're willing to sacrifice anything and everything to reach it. The desire is so strong that it will impose horse blinders on their brain. They will trespass and be trespassed upon, always in preventable ways. They'll contradict the values they supposedly hold dear, showing that those values were justifications all along. </p>
                    
                    <p>In short, don't be afraid to make your protagonist do unspeakable things in the name of conquest. They're going to have plenty of time to do the admirable things later on. For now, they need to be ruthlessly focused on the external thing they want.</p>

                    <br>
    
                    <p>It's not enough that your protagonist is at odds with themselves &mdash; they've got to be at odds with everyone else, too.</p>

                      <p>The midpoint is a <em>major</em> event. In fact, the midpoint is the whole reason I split The Middle into two parts in the first place. You know the goal that your protagonist has been burning bridges and taking bullets to achieve? This is where the pursuit comes to a head. Either they achieve their goal or they fail. We finally made it!</p>

                      <p>But wait, how could they get their goal smack dab in the middle? What is the rest of the story going to be about? Well, that's because this is either a false victory or a false defeat. Remember that this goal was </p>
